## Libraries description
The libraries used, are libraries used in previous labs : 

* avr/io.h        : AVR device-specific IO definitions 
* avr/interrupt.h : Interrupts standard C library for AVR-GCC 
* stdbool.h       : Boolean type and values 
* timer.h         : Timer library for AVR-GCC
* tdlib.h         : C library. Needed for conversion function
* uart.h          : Peter Fleury's UART library
* twi.h           : TWI library for AVR-GCC
* gpio.h          : Contains functions for controlling AVRs' gpio pin(s).
* util/delay.h    : Contains delay functions

## Main application


![Flowchart](https://github.com/AkaiRyussei/Digital-electronics-2/blob/main/Green%20House%20Project/flowchart.png?raw=true)

Our project consists of the operation of an autonomous greenhouse. Our greenhouse has sensors: a light sensor, a temperature sensor and a humidity sensor. The objective of our project is to be able to control these variables in real time so that they remain in optimal intervals for the culture of plants. Therefore, depending on the values of the variables, actions can be taken in order to try to keep the variables in the optimal ranges. Irrigation, opening the window or turning on the fans can be activated. 
For this we have considered the optimal value intervals for humidity, temperature and light, and we have defined the set of actions to be performed for each combination of divergence from these intervals.
